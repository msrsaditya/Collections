   *(Note that here stable == not latest and greatest)*

   42. Arch Linux -- Bleeding edge, rolling release, best for people who want to use the latest and greatest, AUR has every package you want -- but you should be careful using it
   43. Debian -- Stable (old) software, fixed releases, best for people who don't want to update every day and just want a stable system that doesn't change, widest repo ever.
   44. Void -- Rolling release but stable updates, packages available are modest in size (18k), uses musl instead of libc and runit instead of systemd.
   45. Fedora -- Semi-rolling release and semi-stable/bleeding-edge (they call it leading edge). Corporate backed by a company that made some controversial decisions like keeping code behind paywall, upstream for RHEL, updates like fixed release every 6 months, pushes new Linux standards before any other distro.
